## Features

This portfolio is packed with modern, interactive features to create a memorable user experience:

* **Interactive Hero Section:** A dynamic "constellation" background made with `particles.js` that subtly reacts to cursor movement.
* **Custom Cursor:** A custom-designed cursor that provides visual feedback when hovering over interactive elements.
* **Smooth Scroll Animations:** Content gracefully animates into view as the user scrolls, powered by the industry-standard GSAP library.
* **3D Tilting Project Cards:** Project cards have a subtle 3D tilt effect that responds to mouse movement, creating a sense of depth.
* **Thematic Hover Effects:**
    * **Skills:** Bubbles gently lift and glow on hover.
    * **Profiles:** Each profile link has a unique, colorful animation themed to the platform (e.g., data bits for Kaggle, colored particles for Google Cloud).
    * **Timeline:** Custom SVG icons playfully pop out when hovering over educational milestones.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop screens.
* **Single-File Architecture:** The entire website—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—is contained within a single `index.html` file for ultimate portability and easy deployment.
